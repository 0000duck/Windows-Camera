# Win32 Desktop sample applications for using the [Windows Media Capture APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture)

	This folder contains a sample application that demonstrates the Windows Media Capture API usage patterns for using the camera related features in Win32 Desktop applications for Windows 10. 

## Requirements
	
	This sample is built using Visual Studio 2017 and Windows SDK version 17763

## Using the samples

The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the following link or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in Visual Studio 2017.

   [Download the samples ZIP](../../archive/master.zip)

   **Notes:** 
   * Before you unzip the archive, right-click it, select **Properties**, and then select **Unblock**.
   * Be sure to unzip the entire archive, and not just individual samples. The samples all depend on the SharedContent folder in the archive.   
   * In Visual Studio 2017, the platform target defaults to ARM, so be sure to change that to x64 or x86 if you want to test on a non-ARM device. 
   
The samples use Linked files in Visual Studio to reduce duplication of common files, including sample template files and image assets. These common files are stored in the SharedContent folder at the root of the repository, and are referred to in the project files using links.

**Reminder:** If you unzip individual samples, they will not build due to references to other portions of the ZIP file that were not unzipped. You must unzip the entire archive if you intend to build the samples.

For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, please refer to the guidance, tutorials, and reference topics provided in the Windows 10 documentation available in the [Windows Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=532421). These samples are provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows.
